Project Description:
SKY’s engineering teams currently use a spreadsheet to assess and report the health of critical operational areas. 
This process is inefficient and prone to errors. Our project involves:

Developing a web application prototype to replace the spreadsheet.
Using Agile practices such as Story Mapping, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and iterative development.
Creating detailed documentation and presenting our prototype effectively.

Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive layout and navigation.
Data Integrity: Minimized errors and version control issues.
Efficient Reporting: Streamlined process for health check assessments.
